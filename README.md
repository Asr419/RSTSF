Forecasting of Indian Stock Market using Rough Set and Fuzzy-Rough Set based Models
Rough Set models are being practiced for several decades for dealing with vagueness and uncertainty in data. The present paper explores its applicability in forecasting future stock market prices of Indian companies. In this work Rough Set and Fuzzy-Rough Set are used as feature selection techniques in conjunction with CN2 algorithm for generation of rules for future price prediction. Prediction in the present model is in the form of trinary classification, namely it will increase, or decrease or will undergo marginal change. Our experiments suggest that the proposed technique performs significantly better than several popular classification algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and ARIMA.
